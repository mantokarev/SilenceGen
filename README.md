## Repository Description
SilenceGen is a powerful Solana Wallet Creator tool that allows you to generate the address and private key of a Solana wallet. It automates the process of generating seed phrases and checking balances for Solana networks. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is detected, the tool logs and saves the wallet's information, including address, mnemonic, private key, and balances, to a file named `result.txt`.
